<h1><u>Kevin's Past, Present, and Future</u></h1>

<h2>Past</h2>
<p>I was born on July 9, 2002 in a small town in Scotland called Stirling. I lived in another town called Dunblane which is even smaller than Stirling. I went to Newton Primary School until I was 9 when I moved here to Greenville on July 11, 2011. I then went to Sara Collins Elementary School for 4th and 5th grade, and after that, I went to Beck Academy Middle. Ive been to France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, England, Wales, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Canada, USA, and the Bahamas. My family and I go to Ireland every year to visit family. We were there last christmas and on Christmas day my parents said that we were going to Manchester, England to see my favorite soccer team play, <a href="http://www.manutd.com/">Manchester United</a>.</p>

<p>I currently play soccer for <a href="www.carolinaelitesc.com">CESA</a> on the 02 premier team and we are on our way to competing in the South Carolina State cup for our age group. I also play Fifa 18 on Xbox One but I don't do it often because I have to focus on school and soccer.</p>

<h2>Future</h2>
<p> After high school I would like to go to a division 1 <img class=right src="gatech.png" width=300px height=140px> soccer school or <a href="www.gatech.edu">Georgia Tech</a>, depending on the opportunities I get. If I got the chance to play college level soccer, I would most likely choose that school that offered it. If I don't, I would like to go to Georgia Tech to become a computer engineer or programmer because thats the direction in which the world will go in terms of job opportunities.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Meet a professional soccer player for <a href="www.manutd.com">Manchester United</a></li>
