<h1><u>Kevin's Past, Present, and Future</u></h1>

<h2>Past</h2>
<p>I was born on July 9, 2002 in a small town in Scotland called Stirling. I lived in another town called Dunblane which is even smaller than Stirling. I went to Newton Primary School until I was 9 when I moved here to Greenville on July 11, 2011. I then went to Sara Collins Elementary School for 4th and 5th grade, and after that, I went to Beck Academy Middle. Ive been to France, Italy, Spain, Belgium, England, Wales, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Scotland, Canada, USA, and the Bahamas. My family and I go to Ireland every year to visit family. We were there last christmas and on Christmas day my parents said that we were going to Manchester, England to see my favorite soccer team play, <a href="http://www.manutd.com/">Manchester United</a>.</p>
